# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code 2024** challenges. The solutions are implemented in two languages:

- **JavaScript**: For flexible and quick solutions.
- **C**: For more performance-oriented solutions.

Each day's challenge has its solution in either JavaScript or C. If the folder contains a `.js` file, use **Node.js** to run it. If the folder contains a `.c` file, use **GCC** to compile and run it.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bnn16/aoc-2024.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the respective day's folder.

3. If the folder contains a `.js` file, run the solution with Node.js:
   ```bash
   node dayX.js
   ```

4. If the folder contains a `.c` file, compile and run the program with GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc dayX.c -o dayX
   ./dayX
   ```
